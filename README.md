# üåç Satellight Tracker üöÄ  

*A Terminal User Interface (TUI) application for real-time satellite tracking.*  

## üìå Overview  
Satellight Tracker is a **Rust-based TUI application** that provides real-time satellite trajectory tracking.  
It enables users to analyze satellite positions efficiently within the terminal.  

This project integrates with:  
- **Rust-based core logic** for satellite calculations.  
- **Python GUI** (Tkinter) for easy execution.  
- **HTML & CSS documentation** with a structured, glassmorphism-based UI.
